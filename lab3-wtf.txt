why there may apper syntax error between the same command for windows system and Unix MacOs system.
The result is that windows use CRLF style and Mac use LF style
CRLF: is a combination of two characters. Carriage return (CR) is to be used in windows: \r
returns the target to the beginning of the line without advancing to the next line. Line feed (LF) is to be used: 
\n to move the cursor down to the next line without returning to the beginning of the line. When used together (\r\n), 
as is the standard for Windows, they begin a new line.
LF: In Unix systems (macOS), stands for line feed alone (LF) is used to indicate the end of a line of text.
So when using CRLF it may not display correctly on systems using LF. 
It is important to pay attention to the conversion of symbols and commands when transferring text files between Windows 
and Unix systems
