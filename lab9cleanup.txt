setsid()will make the child become session leader. However, this male the normal command ps will not 
leader session, thus i use command man ps to find that the ps -A can check all the session through the terminal
and to find the PID id to find the missing one on command ps.

ask for terminate the stuff we can use kill xxxxxx(PID) to shut down the stuff.
